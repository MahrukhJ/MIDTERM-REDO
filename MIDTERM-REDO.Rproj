#--------------------Question _1--------------------

#Form a hypothesis test of the form, “people with various educational qualifications in Region have different fraction vaxxed compared with other Region.”
#choose different ways to operationalize educational qualification (compare above some level with below that level, but what level?) and different regions
#Please provide estimate, standard error, t-stat and a p-value for the hypothesis test and a confidence interval. 
#Write a short paragraph explaining the test (carefully noting what is the null hypothesis) and explaining the results of that test  

I want to test if people with atleast an associates degree in the West have a different fraction vaxxed compared with people in the South. 

'Null hypothesis:' There is no difference between the fraction of people vaxxed in the West who have at least an associates degree and the fraction of people vaxxed in the South who hold at least an associates.  
'Alternative Hypothesis:' There is a difference between the fraction of people vaxxed in the West who have at least an associates degree and the fraction of people vaxxed in the South who hold at least an associates. 

Significance Level = 0.05
#This means that there is a 5% chance that I can accept the alternative hypothesis when the null hypothesis is actually true. 
#The smaller the significance level, the greater the burden of proof needed to reject the null hypothesis, or in other words, to support the alternative hypothesis.

'This regression will provide the estimate, standard error, t-value and p-value for all of the coefficients, which include each level of education, 
each region and region*education levels, amounting to a total of 34 regression coefficients. Of these coefficients, I will display the relevant ones 
to my null and alternative hypotheses. Personally, I find using the entire category (EEDUC, REGION) in the regression easier than creating separate variables. 
This way, I can compare across all levels of education and all regions and then explore any striking contrasts!'

Overall, the p-value for the Intercept, people living in the West with an associates, people in the West with a bachelors and people in the West with an advanced degree 
read, < 2e-16, 0.00785, 0.00934, 0.01668, respectively, all of which are less than 0.05, the chosen level of significance. This means that I can reject the null
hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis since the p-values indicate strong evidence against the null hypothesis, as there is less than a 5% probability the null is correct.
More specifically, we can reject that there is no difference between the fraction of people vaxxed in the West who have at least an associates degree and the fraction of people
vaxxed in the South who hold at least an associates and accept that there is a difference between the fraction of people vaxxed in the West who have at least an associates degree
and the fraction of people vaxxed in the South who hold at least an associates because the results are statistically significant!

#--------------------Question _2--------------------

'Null Hypothesis:' There is no difference between the fraction of people vaxxed who are female with at least bachelors degree and people who are male with at least a bachelors degree. 
'Alternative Hypothesis:' There is a difference the fraction of people vaxxed who are female with at least bachelors degree and people who are male and have at least a bachelors degree.

Interestingly, the p-values for females with a bachelors degree, females with an advanced degree, males with a bachelors degree
and males with an advanced degree are 4.57e-10, 7.16e-11, 1.60e-08 and 5.69e-09, respectively. All of the p-values are staistically 
significant because they are less than the chosen level of significance, 0.05 which means that we can reject the null hypothesis 
that there is no difference between the fraction of people vaxxed who are female with at least bachelors degree and people who are
male with at least a bachelors degree and instead accept the alternative hypothesis which states that there is a difference between 
the fraction of people vaxxed who are female with at least bachelors degree and people who are male with at least a bachelors degree.

#Form a hypothesis test about an interesting variable.
I think it would be interesting to test whether there is a relationship between having an advanced degree and marital status within my subgroup.

null hypothesis: There is no relationship between having an advanced degree and marital status within my subgroup.
alternative hypothesis: There is a relationship between having an advanced degree and marital status within my subgroup.

Following the results from the regression, the only p-value that is statistically significant at 0.05 is the intercept at 3.62e-06. 
This is low-key surprising to me because I thought there would definitely be significance since marriage is highly stressed upon
in certain parts of Asia. Nonetheless, since the p-values were not statistically significant, this indicates strong evidence for 
the null hypothesis, so we retain the null hypothesis and reject the alternative hypothesis. More specifically, we accept that 
there is no relationship between having an advanced degree and marital status within this subgroup and we reject that there
is a relationship between having an advanced degree and marital status within this subgroup.


#Using a k-nn classifier, can you find relevant information to predict an interesting outcome?
Jumping off of the previous results, I would like to predict marriage within my subgroup. 
^I have already created the variables for the categories within the MS column. 

variables I think would aid in predicting marriage are income, education and anxiety level

Overall, in this k-nn model, the output accuracy is 66.06% and the variables I chose to use to predict marriage
are income between 35k & 49.9, income between 50k & 74.9, education and no anxiety. I thought it would be 
interesting to establish a connection between a persons income, education level and lack of anxiety to marriage
because those are the factors that I would assume comes to mind when considering marriage. If I were to increase the  
output accuracy, I would increase the number of variables by including whether a person eats at restaurants, which might mean
that they are outgoing and if they have private insurance.
